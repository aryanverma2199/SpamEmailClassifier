# Spam Email Classifier

This is a Java-based spam email classifier built using the Maven framework. It uses machine learning algorithms (Naive Bayes or Logistic Regression) to classify emails as spam or ham (non-spam). The project utilizes datasets like SpamAssassin and the Weka machine learning library for training and classification.

## Features
- Classifies emails into spam or ham based on content.
- Uses the SpamAssassin dataset for training.
- Implements Naive Bayes or Logistic Regression algorithms.
- Java NLP libraries are used to process text data.
- Can be deployed as a service with a web interface or an API for classification.

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed on your system:

- **Java Development Kit (JDK)** (version 8 or higher)
- **Apache Maven**
- **Git**

### Clone the Repository
To get started, clone the repository from GitHub:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/aryanverma2199/SpamEmailClassifier.git
cd SpamEmailClassifier

mvn install
Running the Classifier
Once the dependencies are installed, you can run the classifier using the following command:

bash

mvn exec:java -Dexec.mainClass="com.spamclassifier.SpamClassifier"
The classifier will output the classification (spam/ham) for each sample email from the dataset.
Example Output

Email: "Congratulations! You've won a $1,000 Walmart gift card. Click here to claim now." - Classification: spam
Email: "This is a reminder for your appointment tomorrow at 10 AM." - Classification: ham
Email: "Dear user, your account has been compromised. Please verify your identity." - Classification: spam
...
Deployment (Optional)
If you plan to deploy this classifier as a service, you can set up a web interface or an API using technologies like Spring Boot or Node.js for users to submit emails for classification.

Future Improvements
Add more classification algorithms such as SVM or Decision Trees.
Extend to real-time email classification.
Build a user-friendly web interface for easy interaction.
